# Gravitrips
 Artificial Intelligence Project

# Abstract Of The Project:
In this project i have made Game based on the similar iconic 2 player Russian Gravitrips board game of the 80’s which was played between the two humans over a physical board ,I have made the computer game on the same logic only in this case the game is played between a Human(User) and a AI (Machine) where the machine aims to win the game against the Human or atleast Tie the game at the very best.

# Prerequisite to run the code:
-python3.9 version
-In this project I have used the following  Python Libraries-
numpy
random
math
pygame
sys

# Introduction Of The Project:
This is a 2-player game played between the User and the AI where the objective is for the AI to achieve 4 balls in a Row/Column or Diagonal Position while preventing the human from doing the same and the one between AI and Human who achieves both the objective first win’s the game.

# Rules of the game:-
In this Game there would be a grid of 6 rows and 7 columns and the objective of AI is to drop the ball from the sliding row on the top into one of the 7 valid column such that it achieves the objective of 4 consecutive AI balls in a Row/column/any Diagonal .
